Workaround for Battle.net pausing download after a few minutes.

I was unable to determine how to permenently resolve Battle.net from pausing every 10 minutes when downloading a large update or installing a game.
Attempting to restart the download failed and required a relaunch. This got annoying quick and resulted in the creation of this solution.
